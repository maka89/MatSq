# MatSq
Iterative method to find square root of a matrix
- More numerically stable than babylonian method.
- Can make use of initial guess, as opposed to Denman beavers.
- Only matrix multiplications and suc. No inverses in the iteration.

  Uses Newton's method. Step is calculated using Conjugate Gradient, truncated to one or a few iterations.
